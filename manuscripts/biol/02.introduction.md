## Introduction

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a central role regulating cell response to environmental cues during development and homeostasis [@PMID:20602996]. RTK dysregulation contributes to a variety of diseases including cancer [@PMID:15864276]. RTK-targeted therapies are approved for a subset of lung cancer patients and successfully extend and improve patients' lives. However, the effectiveness of these therapies is always limited by resistance. How resistance occurs varies widely, including through mutation of the drug target to block the effect of therapy, amplification of the drug target to overcome inhibition, pharmacokinetic barriers that block trafficking of the drug to tumor cells, and "bypass" switching to alternative pathways not targeted by therapy [@PMID:22439937; @PMID:20118985]. In the case of RTK-targeted therapies, many non-targeted RTKs may become activated to provide bypass resistance [@PMID:24065147]. Two well-studied combinations are the ability of HER3 to provide resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in breast carcinoma, and the ability of Met to provide resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in lung carcinoma [@PMID:22763448; @PMID:24667376; @PMID:20129249; @PMID:30165904; @PMID:21840482]. In each case, the resistance-conferring receptors may contribute to intrinsic or acquired resistance; can become activated by multiple means including ligand-mediated autocrine or paracrine induction, amplification, or mutation; and can effectively be blocked by combination therapy [@PMID:22323597; @PMID:20129249; @PMID:22751098].
