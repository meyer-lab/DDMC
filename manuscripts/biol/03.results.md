### The ability of AXL to confer erlotinib resistance varies among PC9 AXL mutants

![**Phenotypic consequences of AXL YF mutations.** (A-B) After knocking AXL out from PC9 cells using CRISP/Cas9, lentiviral vectors containing the AXL phosphosite mutations and a EGFP separated by an IRES were transduced into the PC9 AXL KO cells. After puromycin selection, the AXL mutant cell lines were sorted for GFP expressing cells. Phenotypic assays were formed wherein cells were treated with either 1ÂµM erlotinib only or and erlotinib and 300nM AXL-activating antibody AF154 to quantify cell viability and  death (YOYO), cell migration, and an island effect. C) Cell migration was observed using Incucyte via a scratch wound assay. D) PC9 WT cells form  "islands" induced by erlotinib which disolve through concomitant activation of AXL. The island effect was quantified by taking the cell-to-cell distance and modeled using Ripley's K function. (E-F) PCA analysis of AXL mutant phenotypes across conditions. In addition to cell migration and island effect, cell viability and cell death were monitored using Incucyte via measuring confluency levels and counting YOYO+ cells, respectively, over time. (G-H) Cell viability time lapse of WT-like Y698F and AXL KO-like Y821F. (I-J) Cell death time lapse of WT-like Y821F and KO-like Y750F. (K-L) Cell migration time lapse of WT-like Y726F and KO-like Y821F. (M-N) Cell island effect quantified by Ripley's K function across radii of WT-like Y726F and KO-like Y750F.](figure1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:pheno width="100%"}

### Our model predicts several upstream components of the YAP patwhay as drivers of AXL-mediated malignant phenotypes

![**Reconstruction of signaling networks driving AXL-mediated malignant phenotypes.** A) Hierarchical clustering of the phosphoproteomic state of AXL mutants treated with erlotinib for 4h and subsequently with erlotinib and AF154 for 10min. B) Actual vs predictive pearson's correlation coefficients fitting PLSR models with different clustering strategies. The best performing number of components were picked for each model. (C-D) PSLR scores and loadings of a PLSR model fit to DDMC cluster centers. (E-H) Centers and (I-L) PSSM motifs of clusters 1, 3, 4 and 5. (M) Upstream kinase predictions calculated using the Frobenius distance between PSPL profiles and cluster PSSMs.](figure2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:model width="100%"}
