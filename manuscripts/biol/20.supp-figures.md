### Phenotypic consequences of PC9 AXL mutants

![**Cell viability time course of AXL mutants.** (A-J) Fold-change cell viability of PC9 AXL mutants treated with erlotinib only or erlotinib and AF154 over time. Note that confluency levels were normalized to 24h and subsequently to the cell viability levels of cells treated with erlotinib only.](figureS1.svg){#fig:viability width="100%", tag="S1"}

### Prediction performance of PLSR models using different clustering strategies

![**Different PLSR modeling strategies to predict AXL-mediated phenotypes.** A) Leave-one-out cross-validation diagram. R2Y/Q2Y error and actual versus predicted correlation coefficient of PLSR models fit to (B-C) unclustered raw data (D-E) k-means clusters (F-G) GMM clusters (H-I) DDMC clusters using only the sequence information or (J-K) DDMC clusters using both the p-signal and the peptide sequences. For each PLSR model the number of components providing the best predictive performance were used. ](figureS5.svg){#fig:PLSRs width="100%", tag="S5"}
