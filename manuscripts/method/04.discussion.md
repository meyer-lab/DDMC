## Discussion

MS-based global phosphoproteomic data provides unparalleled coverage to interrogate signaling networks and its therapeutic implications. However, these data present challenging issues such as undersampling of the phosphoproteome and its high-content but low-sample-throughput nature. Previous efforts in regressing signaling measurements against phenotypic or clinical data were based on the great ability of certain regression models such as PLSR or LASSO to robustly handle prediction in the presence of high-dimensional and correlated data. This is an excellent strategy with moderately large phosphoproteomic data sets. However, as the number of phosphosites-or variablesâ€”increases, the system becomes increasingly underdetermined and the prediction power diminishes. In addition, while these models can generally be predictive with such data, they are not easily interpretable. For instance, with PLSR models as each loading represents the weight of a particular peptide, the loadings plot results in an overwhelming accumulation of individual peptides occupying all principal component weights. Therefore, clustering large-scale MS measurements based on biologically meaningful features and utilizing the cluster averages to fit regression methods could enhance the predictive performance of the model while providing highly interpretable results wherein clusters constitute signaling nodes distinctly correlated with cell phenotypes or clinical features.
