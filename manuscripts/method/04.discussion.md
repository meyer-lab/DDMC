## Discussion

MS-based global phosphoproteomic data provides unparalleled coverage to interrogate signaling networks and its therapeutic implications. However, these data present challenging issues such as undersampling of the phosphoproteome and its high-content but low-sample-throughput nature. Previous efforts in regressing signaling measurements against phenotypic or clinical data were based on the great ability of certain regression models such as PLSR or LASSO to robustly handle prediction in the presence of high-dimensional and correlated data. This is an excellent strategy with moderately large phosphoproteomic data sets. However, as the number of phosphosites-or variablesâ€”increases, the system becomes increasingly underdetermined and the prediction power diminishes. In addition, while these models can generally be predictive with such data, they are not easily interpretable. For instance, with PLSR models as each loading represents the weight of a particular peptide, the loadings plot results in an overwhelming accumulation of individual peptides occupying all principal component weights. Therefore, clustering large-scale MS measurements based on biologically meaningful features and utilizing the cluster averages to fit regression methods could enhance the predictive performance of the model while providing highly interpretable results wherein clusters constitute signaling nodes distinctly correlated with cell phenotypes or clinical features.


SLK has been shown to play a role in cancer cell motility and invasiveness via interaction with SRC&CK2 [@PMID:16837460] and HER2 [@PMID:19525980] in addition to cytoskeletal remodeling proteins. Moreover, a novel ALK inhibitor ensartinib (X-396) that has shown promising clinical activity in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in a phase 1/2 trial [@PMID:29563138] target a handful of additional kinases including SLK. Nevertheless, the invovlement of SLK in LUAD has not been explored yet. Kikuchi et al observed an overexpression of PAK2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient samples via a shotgun proteomics analysis which was subsequently validated by histoimmunochemistry [@PMID:22761400]. The inhibition of CK2 has been shown to sensitize NSCLC tumors to cisplatin via upregulation of PML [@PMID:28744813] and to inionizing radiation [@PMID:29170453]. Lastly, ERK2 is an frequently observed as a prognostic marker of resistance to targeted therapies inducing tumorigenesis in several cancer types. Brognard et al demonstrated that constitutive ERK1/2 activity in NSCLC cells promotes survival and chemotherapeutic survival [@PMID:12181740].
