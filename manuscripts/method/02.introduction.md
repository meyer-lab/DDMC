## Introduction

Here's a potential outline of an introduction:

- Kinase signaling / phophoproteomics in general
- Potential issues when using phosphoproteomics towards certain goals
    + Missingness is a function of sample and facility [@PMID:19921851]
- Computational methods to deal with phosphoproteomics
    + Kinase set enrichment analysis algorithm [@DOI:10.1126/scisignal.2003573]
    + Use activation loop as proxy for activity
    + Kinase-substrate prediction: KinasePhos [@PMID:15980458; @PMID:17517770], Networkin [21], and NetPhosK [37]
- Benefit of data-dependent modeling over kinase prediction
    + Phosphorylation is a consequence of kinase specificity, localization, and other factors.
    + Kinase-substrate prediction has known biases.
    + Kinase prediction may interact poorly with the missingness problem in phosphoproteomics.
