### Sequence Modeling

![**Schematic of the DDMC simultaneous data and peptide sequence clustering approach** Peptides are initialized into clusters at random. The measurements of abundance are represented by a multivariate Gaussian mixture model where each dimension of the distribution represents the abundance within a sample. Next, an expectation-maximization fitting scheme is used. During the expectation step, the distance of each peptide sequence to each cluster is calculated. This is done either through a binomial enrichment scheme (method 1) or using the average PAM250 distance (method 2). In parallel, the distance of each peptide abundance is compared to the cluster centers. These two distances are combined to update the assignments of each peptide to each cluster. During the maximization step, the cluster centers of the data are updated based on the weighted average of the peptide abundances in each condition. The peptide motifs are similarly updated through a weighted combination of the assigned peptides. Both steps continue sequentially until the change in peptide assignments between each iteration drops below a threshold.](EM_diagram.svg){#fig:methodS width="100%", tag="S1"}
