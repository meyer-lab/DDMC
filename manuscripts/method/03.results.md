### Constructing an expectation-maximization algorithm tailored to cluster phosphoproteomic data

MS-based global phosphoproteomic data provides unparalleled coverage to interrogate signaling networks and its therapeutic implications. However, these data present challenging issues such as undersampling of the phosphoproteome, its high-content but low-sample-throughput nature, and the presence of missing values in large-scale phosphoproteomics data sets. To tackle these issues, we have built an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that probabilistically and simultaneously models the peptide phosphorylation levels with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the peptide sequences using either a PAM250 transition matrix, or a binomial position enrichment model (Supplemental Fig. 1). In each iteration, DDMC's recursive algorithm optimizes the clusters of phosphopeptides until the peptides included in each final cluster displays conserved kinase motifs in addition to similar phosphorylation behaviors (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that this dual clustering criteria will provide the user with more biologically meaningul clusters than with either sequence or data alone since, given the relevance of kinase specificity in signaling networks, the peptide sequences provide additional useful information into the global signaling context. Next, the resulting cluster centers can be used to fit regression models and predict features of interest (e.g. phenotyes or clinical outcomes) in order to establish associations between particular clusters and such features (Fig. 1B). This helps identify what specific clusters are meaningful in a specific study versus those that are not. For instance, as illustreated by Fig. 1C, clusters 1, 2, and 3 each explain a particular phenotye along PC1 and PC2, whereas cluster 4 may not be as directly implicated as their counterparts. Finally, the incorporation of the sequence information into the model and the subsequent generation of representative cluster motifs provides the opportunity of quantifying the similarity between a cluster's position-specific-scoring matrix (PSSM) and the specificity profiles of putative upstream kinaes, also in the form of a PSSM, generated via Position Specific Scanning Libraries (PSPL). In this biochemical assay, a kinase of interest is incubated with disparate biotinylated peptide libraries to find the "optimal" substrate motif [CITE]. We extracted a collection of 62 kinase specificity profiles to find what cluster motifs resemble most accuratly the optimal motif of putative upstream kinases. To do so, we compute the Frobenius norm for all pairwise combinations between cluster PSSMs and PSPL PSSMs to predict what upstream kinases might be modulating specific clusters (Fig 1C).

### Dual data-motif clustering strategy improves phosphoproteomic clustering

To evaluate the robustness of our combinad dual data-motif clustering (DDMC) method in analyzing incomplete data sets, we designed a computational experiment wherein we removed specific observations and attempted to predict them using the cluster centers corresponding to the peptides those missing values belonged to (Figure 2A). The resulting mean squared errors between the actual and predicted values were compared to compared to commonly used imputation strategies such as the peptides' mean or minimum signal. Furthermore, we evaluated the imputation performance of our method when clustering the data by phosphorylation signal only, by sequence similarity only, or by combining both information sources (2B-D). These results indicate that MDCC clearly imputes missing values more accurately than the peptides' mean signal in all three cases. No noticeable differences were observed in the imputations performance using data or sequence only, or a mix of both. Next, we re-implemented this strategy to find out what number of clusters (2E) and weight (2F) yielded more accurate predictions. We found that a larger number of clusters and smaller weights (prioritizing phospho-signal over peptide sequence) minimized the imputation error. These data suggests that DDMC outperforms standard imputation strategies such as peptide mean signal (and minimum signal).

![**Benchmarking the robustness of motif clustering to missing measurements.** A) A schematic of the process for quantifying robustness to missing values. Any peptides containing less than 7 TMT experiments were discarded. For the remaining 15904 peptides, an entire random TMT experiment was removed per peptide and these values were stored for later comparison. Next, these artifical missing values were imputed using either a baseline strategy (peptide mean/minimum signal) or the corresponding cluster center. Once a mean squared error was computed for each peptide, the second iteration repeats this process by removing a second TMT experiment. A total of 5 random TMT experiments per peptide were imputed by clustering using either the peptides' phosphorylation signal only (B), the peptides' sequence only (C) or a mix of both information sources (D). The imputation errors were calculated across different number of clusters (E) and different data-vs-sequence weights (F).](figureM2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:tn width="100%"}


### Shared differences between tumor and normal adjascent tissue

We explored whether DDMC could recognize conserved signaling differences in tumors compared with normal adjacen tissue (NAT) samples. To do so, we fit DDMC using the binomial sequence distance method with 24 clusters and a weight of 15 (Fig. 1, 2E, F). Hierarchical clustering of the cluster centers shows a noticeable contrasting signal between tumor and NAT samples. Peptides contained in clusters 2 and 11 display noticeably low signaling levels in NATs whereas they show high signal in several the tumor samples. Similarly, clusters 16, 4, 24, 12, 1, and 15 show this signaling pattern, however these peptides display a slightly higher signal in NAT samples and practically all peptides in tumor samples are enriched. Conversely, clusters 3 and 21––most prominently––as well as clusters 20, 6, and 23 show the inverse signaling pattern (Fig. 3A). The scores of the PCA analysis of the cluster centers further underscore the striking signaling differences between tumor——positively weighted across principal component (PC) 1—— and NAT samples——negative weighted across PC1——(Fig. 3B). LOADINGS DO NOT MATCH WITH E.G. CLUSTER 11 TRACKS WITH NATS ALONG PC1 BUT SIGNAL MUCH HIGHER IN TUMORS (D). Additionally, we asked whether for every cluster the signaling between tumor versus NAT samples were statistically different. We performed Mann Whitney rank tests and found that all clusters display significantly different phosphorylation levels in their tumor samples compared with NATs (Fig. 3D). Next, we fit an elastic net logistic regression model to predict sample type (tumor or NAT) using the cluster centers. All samples were correctly predicted except from one, again highlighting the striking differences in signaling between cancer and normal cells (Fig. 3E&F). Most of these signaling differences were expleined by cluster 11 (Fig. G). With this information, we decided to further explore clusters 11, 12, and 23. By looking at what residues where enriched across all peptide positions, we found that cluster 11 contains phospho-serine peptides only with a strong conservation for K in the motif's C-terminus, a clear enrichment of F at -1, and a mix enrichment of Y, K, M and H at +1 (3H). Overall, these cluster shows a clear enrichment of basic residues across most of the peptide positions. In contrast, cluster 12——also containing phospho-serine peptides only——displays a motif with a clear enrichment for acidic residues. In addition, this cluster shows a large enrichment of Y at -1 and K at +2 (3I). Next, we extracted a collection of kinase specificity profiles of 62 kinases generated by positional scanning peptide library (PSPL)——wherein a kinase of interest is incubated with disparate biotinylated peptide libraries to find the "optimal" substrate motif——from the literature [CITE] to find what cluster PSSM motifs resemble most accurately the optimal motif of these putative upstream kinases. To do so, we computed the frobenius norm for all pairwise combinations between cluster PSSMs and PSPL matrices and found that cluster 11 might be modulated by upstream kinases SLK and PAK2; cluster 12 by CKII, SRC, and TbetaRII, and cluster 23 by ERK2, and DMPK1. (Fig. 3J)

### Phosphoproteomic aberations associated with genetic tumor differences

We then explored signaling differences according to the genetic background of LUAD patients. The gene most frequently mutated in these patient is TP53, so we again performed statistical testing and logistic regression to find what clusters show the largest difference between TP53 WT and mutant samples. The Mann Whitney tests showed that most of the clusters were highly significant with most of their signal increased in mutant over WT samples. Again, cluster 12 displayed a striking difference between both groups (Fig. 3A).
