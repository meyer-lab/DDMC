### Constructing an expectation-maximization algorithm tailored to cluster phosphoproteomic data

s multiplied by a user-defined weight which scales both scores so that a weight of 0 or a very large number only scores the data or sequence, respectively. Importantly, the final scores represent the relative probabilities that define the partial membership of the query peptide to each cluster. In other words, the EM algorithm provides soft cluster assignments for every peptide. Then, the GMM parameters and cluster sequences are updated during the M-step based on the assignments generated during the previous E-step. These two steps repeat until convergence.

![**Schematic of the DDMC simultaneous data and peptide sequence clustering approach.** Peptides are initialized into clusters at random. The measurements of abundance are represented by a multivariate Gaussian mixture model where each dimension of the distribution represents the abundance within a sample. Next, an expectation-maximization fitting scheme is used. During the expectation step, the distance of each peptide sequence to each cluster is calculated. This is done either through a binomial enrichment scheme (method 1) or using the average PAM250 distance (method 2). In parallel, the distance of each peptide abundance is compared to the cluster centers. These two distances are combined to update the assignments of each peptide to each cluster. During the maximization step, the cluster centers of the data are updated based on the weighted average of the peptide abundances in each condition. The peptide motifs are similarly updated through a weighted combination of the assigned peptides. Both steps continue sequentially until the change in peptide assignments between each iteration drops below a threshold.](EM_diagram.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:method width="100%"}


### Dual data-motif clustering strategy improves phosphoproteomic clustering

To evaluate the robustness of our combinad dual data-motif clustering (DDMC) method in analyzing incomplete data sets, we designed a computational experiment wherein we removed specific observations and attempted to predict them using the cluster centers corresponding to the peptides those missing values belonged to (Figure 2A). The resulting mean squared errors between the actual and predicted values were compared to compared to commonly used imputation strategies such as the peptides' mean or minimum signal. Furthermore, we evaluated the imputation performance of our method when clustering the data by phosphorylation signal only, by sequence similarity only, or by combining both information sources (2B-D). These results indicate that MDCC clearly imputes missing values more accurately than the peptides' mean signal in all three cases. No noticeable differences were observed in the imputations performance using data or sequence only, or a mix of both. Next, we re-implemented this strategy to find out what number of clusters (2E) and weight (2F) yielded more accurate predictions. We found that a larger number of clusters and smaller weights (prioritizing p-signal over peptide sequence) minimized the imputation error. These data suggests that DDMC outperforms standard imputation strategies such as peptide mean signal (and minimum signal).   

#TODO: 
- Compare to minimum signal
- Compare to GMSimpute/DreamAI
- Add legend for each regression line in plots B-F and mix labels/titles

![**Benchmarking the robustness of motif clustering to missing measurements.** A) A schematic of the process for quantifying robustness to missing values. Any peptides containing less than 7 TMT experiments were discarded. For the remaining 15904 peptides, an entire random TMT experiment was removed per peptide and these values were stored for later comparison. Next, these artifical missing values were imputed using either a baseline strategy (peptide mean/minimum signal) or the corresponding cluster center. Once a mean squared error was computed for each peptide, the second iteration repeats this process by removing a second TMT experiment. A total of 5 random TMT experiments per peptide were imputed by clustering using either the peptides' phosphorylation signal only (B), the peptides' sequence only (C) or a mix of both information sources (D). The imputation errors were calculated across different number of clusters (E) and different data-vs-sequence weights (F).](figureM2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:tn width="100%"}
