### Constructing an expectation-maximization algorithm tailored to cluster phosphoproteomic data

MS-based global phosphoproteomic data provides unparalleled coverage to interrogate signaling networks and its therapeutic implications. However, these data present challenging issues such as undersampling of the phosphoproteome, its high-content but low-sample-throughput nature, and the presence of missing values in large-scale phosphoproteomics data sets. To tackle these issues, we have built an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that probabilistically and simultaneously models the peptide phosphorylation levels with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the peptide sequences using either a PAM250 transition matrix, or a binomial position enrichment model (Fig. 1 and methods section). The user-defined variables of this algorithm are the number of clusters the scaling factor or weight to prioritize the data or the sequence scores. During the Expectation– or E-step, the algorithm guesses a data and a sequence probability distribution given the current model parameters to assign every peptide into a cluster based on its maximum likelihood estimation. That is, the GMM generates the probabilities of each phosphosite being assigned to every cluster according to its log-transformed abundance. In the PAM250 method, the average distance between a peptide’s sequence and each of those within a cluster are calculated using the transition matrix. For the binomial method, we collected 333,492 random MS-generated phosphopeptides from the public compendium PhosphoSitePlus13 to be used as the set of background sequences. The probability of observing each amino acid at each position was calculated by comparing each cluster and the background using an incomplete beta function. First, the cluster sequences are used to build counts matrices displaying the number of amino acid occurrences across positions. These matrices are then individually compared to the weighted frequencies matrix of the background set of sequences using a binomially distributed model in order to generate a binomial probability matrix for each cluster. The probability of a peptide being assigned to any cluster is the average of each position’s probability present in the correspondinog cluster’s binomial probability matrix. For each cluster, the final score is the sum of the GMM and sequence scores multiplied by a user-defined weight which scales both scores so that a weight of 0 or a very large number only scores the data or sequence, respectively. Importantly, the final scores represent the relative probabilities that define the partial membership of the query peptide to each cluster. In other words, the EM algorithm provides soft cluster assignments for every peptide. Then, the GMM parameters and cluster sequences are updated during the M-step based on the assignments generated during the previous E-step. These two steps repeat until convergence.

![**Schematic of the DDMC simultaneous data and peptide sequence clustering approach.** Peptides are initialized into clusters at random. The measurements of abundance are represented by a multivariate Gaussian mixture model where each dimension of the distribution represents the abundance within a sample. Next, an expectation-maximization fitting scheme is used. During the expectation step, the distance of each peptide sequence to each cluster is calculated. This is done either through a binomial enrichment scheme (method 1) or using the average PAM250 distance (method 2). In parallel, the distance of each peptide abundance is compared to the cluster centers. These two distances are combined to update the assignments of each peptide to each cluster. During the maximization step, the cluster centers of the data are updated based on the weighted average of the peptide abundances in each condition. The peptide motifs are similarly updated through a weighted combination of the assigned peptides. Both steps continue sequentially until the change in peptide assignments between each iteration drops below a threshold.](DDMC_functional_diagram.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:method width="100%"}


### Dual data-motif clustering strategy improves phosphoproteomic clustering

To evaluate the robustness of our combinad dual data-motif clustering (DDMC) method in analyzing incomplete data sets, we designed a computational experiment wherein we removed specific observations and attempted to predict them using the cluster centers corresponding to the peptides those missing values belonged to (Figure 2A). The resulting mean squared errors between the actual and predicted values were compared to compared to commonly used imputation strategies such as the peptides' mean or minimum signal. Furthermore, we evaluated the imputation performance of our method when clustering the data by phosphorylation signal only, by sequence similarity only, or by combining both information sources (2B-D). These results indicate that MDCC clearly imputes missing values more accurately than the peptides' mean signal in all three cases. No noticeable differences were observed in the imputations performance using data or sequence only, or a mix of both. Next, we re-implemented this strategy to find out what number of clusters (2E) and weight (2F) yielded more accurate predictions. We found that a larger number of clusters and smaller weights (prioritizing phospho-signal over peptide sequence) minimized the imputation error. These data suggests that DDMC outperforms standard imputation strategies such as peptide mean signal (and minimum signal).

![**Benchmarking the robustness of motif clustering to missing measurements.** A) A schematic of the process for quantifying robustness to missing values. Any peptides containing less than 7 TMT experiments were discarded. For the remaining 15904 peptides, an entire random TMT experiment was removed per peptide and these values were stored for later comparison. Next, these artifical missing values were imputed using either a baseline strategy (peptide mean/minimum signal) or the corresponding cluster center. Once a mean squared error was computed for each peptide, the second iteration repeats this process by removing a second TMT experiment. A total of 5 random TMT experiments per peptide were imputed by clustering using either the peptides' phosphorylation signal only (B), the peptides' sequence only (C) or a mix of both information sources (D). The imputation errors were calculated across different number of clusters (E) and different data-vs-sequence weights (F).](figureM2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:tn width="100%"}


### Shared differences between tumor and normal adjascent tissue

We explored whether DDMC could recognize conserved signaling differences in tumors compared with normal adjacen tissue (NAT) samples. To do so, we fit DDMC using the binomial sequence distance method with 24 clusters and a weight of 15 (Fig. 1, 2E, F). Hierarchical clustering of the cluster centers shows a noticeable contrasting signal between tumor and NAT samples. Peptides contained in clusters 2 and 11 display noticeably low signaling levels in NATs whereas they show high signal in several the tumor samples. Similarly, clusters 16, 4, 24, 12, 1, and 15 show this signaling pattern, however these peptides display a slightly higher signal in NAT samples and practically all peptides in tumor samples are enriched. Conversely, clusters 3 and 21––most prominently––as well as clusters 20, 6, and 23 show the inverse signaling pattern (Fig. 3A). The scores of the PCA analysis of the cluster centers further underscore the striking signaling differences between tumor——positively weighted across principal component (PC) 1—— and NAT samples——negative weighted across PC1——(Fig. 3B). LOADINGS DO NOT MATCH WITH E.G. CLUSTER 11 TRACKS WITH NATS ALONG PC1 BUT SIGNAL MUCH HIGHER IN TUMORS (D). Additionally, we asked whether for every cluster the signaling between tumor versus NAT samples were statistically different. We performed Mann Whitney rank tests and found that all clusters display significantly different phosphorylation levels in their tumor samples compared with NATs (Fig. 3D). Next, we fit an elastic net logistic regression model to predict sample type (tumor or NAT) using the cluster centers. All samples were correctly predicted except from one, again highlighting the striking differences in signaling between cancer and normal cells (Fig. 3E&F). Most of these signaling differences were expleined by cluster 11 (Fig. G). With this information, we decided to further explore clusters 11, 12, and 23. By looking at what residues where enriched across all peptide positions, we found that cluster 11 contains phospho-serine peptides only with a strong conservation for K in the motif's C-terminus, a clear enrichment of F at -1, and a mix enrichment of Y, K, M and H at +1 (3H). Overall, these cluster shows a clear enrichment of basic residues across most of the peptide positions. In contrast, cluster 12——also containing phospho-serine peptides only——displays a motif with a clear enrichment for acidic residues. In addition, this cluster shows a large enrichment of Y at -1 and K at +2 (3I). Next, we extracted a collection of kinase specificity profiles of 62 kinases generated by positional scanning peptide library (PSPL)——wherein a kinase of interest is incubated with disparate biotinylated peptide libraries to find the "optimal" substrate motif——from the literature [CITE] to find what cluster PSSM motifs resemble most accurately the optimal motif of these putative upstream kinases. To do so, we computed the frobenius norm for all pairwise combinations between cluster PSSMs and PSPL matrices and found that cluster 11 might be modulated by upstream kinases SLK and PAK2; cluster 12 by CKII, SRC, and TbetaRII, and cluster 23 by ERK2, and DMPK1. (Fig. 3J)

### Phosphoproteomic aberations associated with genetic tumor differences

We then explored signaling differences according to the genetic background of LUAD patients. The gene most frequently mutated in these patient is TP53, so we again performed statistical testing and logistic regression to find what clusters show the largest difference between TP53 WT and mutant samples. The Mann Whitney tests showed that most of the clusters were highly significant with most of their signal increased in mutant over WT samples. Again, cluster 12 displayed a striking difference between both groups (Fig. 3A).
